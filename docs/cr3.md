# Canon CR3 decoding

The CR3 adapter reads the CRX Bayer track, `CMP1` compression descriptor,
`CDI1`/`IAD1` sensor geometry and timed `CTMD` maker notes. White balance,
black/white levels and the default crop come from the file. A Dual Pixel delta
track is never substituted for the primary Bayer track.

The in-camera aspect ratio (3:2, 4:3, 16:9, 1:1) is not applied to the sensor data. The maker note's
`AspectInfo` (tag `0x009a`: aspect code, cropped width, height, left, top) gives the shot's rectangle inside the
recommended crop, and the decoder uses it as the default crop, so the developed image has the shape the photographer
framed (PowerShot SX70 HS, EOS 250D, PowerShot G5 X Mark II, EOS M6 Mark II and EOS M50 samples). A rectangle that
is missing or does not fit inside the crop is ignored. The embedded JPEG still shows the whole frame.

The decoder is independent Rust code shared by desktop, CLI and WebAssembly;
it has no operating-system imaging dependency or external decoder. Its sources
are the public prose descriptions and patents cited in
`crates/raw/src/vendor/crx.rs`. Unsupported coding variants retain the existing
embedded-JPEG fallback and its visible warning when a JPEG is present. So does
any other CR3 decode error (a corrupt file, or a body whose CRX stream the
decoder misreads): every CR3 opened from its embedded JPEG before this decoder,
and only three bodies are verified, so a CR3 never fails to import or load
where a usable preview exists. If a JPEG preview is missing, non-JPEG (for example
HEVC), or cannot be decoded, the engine develops the file's reduced Bayer RAW
track as a fallback. Its levels, white balance, crop and orientation are retained;
full-sensor maker-note borders are not applied to the smaller mosaic. Import,
quick previews and rendering share this fallback. Unsupported primary RAW
variants still import with the existing preview-only warning and the reduced
preview's dimensions. HEVC itself remains unsupported. When the primary RAW
also cannot be decoded, files with neither a usable JPEG nor a decodable reduced
Bayer track report an error. A sensor preview is never used as a camera-JPEG
colour-fitting reference.

## Verified sensor decoding

CRX version `0x100`, four Bayer planes and `ff01`/`ff02`/`ff03` marker headers
support lossless RAW and three-level C-RAW with horizontal tiles. Uniform
quantization values 4–43 are independently verified. Version `0x200` C-RAW
supports the `ff11`/`ff12`/`ff13` marker family, a single 14-bit Bayer tile and
its adaptive quantization map. C-RAW is quantized, so next to clipped highlights
its reconstruction can overshoot the sensor range by a few quantization steps
(up to 36 codes above 16383 in 17 CC0 files); those samples are clamped to the
CMP1 bit depth. A lossless sample outside the bit depth is still corrupt data.
Other unverified coding variants return explicit unsupported errors. Header probing validates the same coding variants and
tile/plane layout as full decoding.

`crates/raw/tests/cr3_corpus.rs` checks every full-sensor sample against a
black-box reference, before cropping or colour processing. Public CC0 files
are downloaded by `cargo xtask corpus --download` and kept outside version
control. The exact inputs and reference hashes are:

Reference pixels were observed from the DNGLab 0.8.0 macOS arm64 release
binary; no decoder source was read or copied, and it is not shipped or linked.
The release ZIP SHA-256 was
`ee70805cb60f18d5ed62548c4e595f6cee0a33407e15358eb1766a46afc1c16e`.
All six sensor comparisons pass. R8 HEVC preview tracks are distinguished from
the primary Bayer RAW; the HEVC preview itself is not decoded. Missing corpus
files are reported as skipped by the tests.

The version `0x200` QP predictor and entropy framing were checked independently.
Controlled input mutations establish floor averaging of paired QP rows before
the nonlinear integer table, then multiplication, division by eight, addition
of the subband base and a minimum step of one. QP values 131–167 are verified;
unmeasured values are rejected.

An odd QP-map height (EOS R7: 4732 sensor rows give 1183 QP rows) leaves the
last row of the second-level high-frequency bands without a partner row; that
row's QP is used on its own. The odd-height map decodes to the exact end of its
entropy stream. This rule is not yet checked against a black-box reference:
it was checked on paired R7 RAW and C-RAW captures of the same scene (ISO 100
and 6400), whose developed images match visually and whose sensor means agree
within 0.1% at ISO 6400. Files with even-height maps never reach this rule, so
the six verified fixtures are unchanged. Partial-subband and
rounded-plane coding, vertical C-RAW tiling and adaptive low-frequency gains
remain unsupported. The decoder bounds image dimensions, sample count,
tile count, marker headers and temporary allocations. The full sensor buffer is
allocated only after the first plane decodes, and plane buffers grow row by row,
so a small crafted file fails before reserving memory for the image it claims.

## Colour limits

CR3 carries as-shot white balance but no measured camera matrix is imported
here. The existing guarded embedded-JPEG fitting path now includes CR3, with
both proxies oriented identically before gathering training pairs. A bounded
crop/translation registration of the JPEG is confirmed on held-out edge
directions before fitting colour; the existing held-out colour acceptance gates
are unchanged. No lens distortion correction is applied (LightCraft has no lens
profiles of its own yet), so lenses whose camera JPEG is strongly
distortion-corrected may fail the gates and keep the neutral matrix. Render
cache version 13 invalidates earlier thumbnails. All developed pixels still come
from the RAW sensor; a rejected colour fit retains the documented neutral
matrix fallback. See `camera-preview-colour.md` for the limits of this estimate.
